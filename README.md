# Golembase TypeScript Starter App

Tip: If you clone this repo, delete the .git folder that gets created by typing the following, which also creates a new repo:

```
rm -rf .git
git init
git branch -m main
```

After copying/cloning this repo, run

```
npm install
```

to install what's already in the package.json file.

Also note: We've included eslint and prettier in here as well.
